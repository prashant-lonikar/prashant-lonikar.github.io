		bio: 'As a Climate Finance Analyst at ClimateAligned, I specialize in leveraging technology and AI to address climate issues. I bring a unique blend of engineering and business analytics skills, with a passion for sustainability and sustainable finance. I joined the team as the first hire, and as with any good startup, I was involved in a bit of everything. I\'ve also engaged in data collection and analysis, website building using no-code tools, Git work, and developing climate strategies for banks in the Middle East and Africa. Notably, I collaborated closely with developers and the design team on our first product which we presented at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. My goal is to drive funds towards sustainable projects globally, aligning with the Paris 1.5 degrees target.',
